    <h1>Tim Manley</h1>
    <p>This is a website all about me!</p>

    <h2>The purpose</h2>
    <p>The idea of this website is to serve as a hub 
        for all things Tim Manley related. Note that 
        it is currently in development. It will also 
        showcase all of my current CompSci projects</p>
