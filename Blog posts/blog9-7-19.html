                <h1>First blog post!</h1>
                <br>
                <p>This first blog post isn't going to be very substantial, more like a foreword as to what I'll be getting up to in the future. I am writing this now in my first version of the website, which is very minimal, boasting only 4 pages and a navbar. <br><br> For the layout and CSS I am using bootstrap, which so far has yielded good results, being simple to use and with the added benefit of automatic cross-compatibility. To write the blogs, I am taking the very sub-optimal approach of writing them directly into the html of this page. I will have to come up with a better solution in the future, however for the sake of just getting this site going, and getting a first post up, this will have to do. <br><br> I suppose now would be a good time to talk about my visions for the future, both in terms of this website, and my education as a whole. For this webiste, I'm aiming to put all of my projects, from this point on, on the site in order to showcase both what I can do, and my progression and improvement, sort of like an archive. As for me, it is the start of the summer holidays and in order to be productive I am sitting here writing this blog, which will serve me well in the future what with university applications and with finding a job. <br><br> Who knows, maybe this site will get no foot traffic, or maybe it will blow up; maybe it will land me my dream job, or maybe it will be a complete waste of time. Ultimately, whatever the fate of this website, or indeed myself, as long as I'm genuinely enjoying myself (and that I am!) I'll consider it a worthwhile endeavour.</p>
