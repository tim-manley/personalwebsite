                <br>
                <p>A week after the establishment of this website and, well not a lot has changed! I've added an "About Me" page, and actually populated the projects page with a project (although I haven't yet put the project on it's page yet...). And once again, this blog is being written using that famous word formatter: Visual Studio Code. Oh well! <br><br>
                Anyway, what else have I been up to in the past week? Well I ordered and started reading the book "Algorithms to Live By" by Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths. I have read the first chapter, entitled "optimal stopping" which outlines the use of algorithms in determining when to stop searching and start choosing, the most famous example being "the secretary problem". Aside from being an extremely interesting read (I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who has stumbled accross my blog), it also gave me the idea for my first summer side project (not including this website of course). And in this side project, I went about "solving" the secretary problem using a computer model. More details of the project can be found <a href="../Projects/Optimal Stopping/optimal-stop.html">here</a>. In the future I would like to further improve this project, perhaps expanding it's useful "scope" beyond that of just the secretary problem. <br><br>
                I have also started work on another website. As a member of The Incognitos (Eton's top close harmony group) for 2019/20, I have realised that the group are lacking a website. So naturally, I spoke to our keeper, Albert Soriano, and he has "commissioned" me to design the website (it was more of a "hey I want to design the website", to which he replied "sure"!). And progress is good so far, I like the design better than that which I have used on this my very own website! <br><br>
                All in all, it has been a productive week, and having just started the next chapter of Algorithms to Live By, I may have had an idea for a next project...</p>
